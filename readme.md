## Documentation

This is a test repository meant to illustrate documentation possibilities on github.

The `feature_importance` folder contains a markdown file.
The `model_evaluation` folder contains an rst file.

## Table of contents

* [feature importance](https://github.com/kklein/documentation_test/blob/main/feature_importances/page1.md)
* [model evaluation](https://github.com/kklein/documentation_test/blob/main/model_evaluation/page1.rst)

## How does working on it look like?
On the one hand, one would be able to edit the source text directly on GitHub. GitHub provides a 'Preview' tab:

On the other hand, one would be able to edit the markdown files locally. Some plug-ins should be able to illustrate all of the markdown and most of the LaTeX features. E.g. see [marp extension for VS Code](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-vscode):

Other plug-ins, e.g. [Markdown + Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) seem to offer similar functionalities. I'd hope similar tooling exists for other editors and IDEs.
