This is a test repo to illustrate documentation possibilities on github.

## Table of contents

## How does working on it look like?
On the one hand, one would be able to edit the source text directly on GitHub. GitHub provides a 'Preview' tab:

On the other hand, one would be able to edit the markdown files locally. Some plug-ins should be able to illustrate all of the markdown and most of the LaTeX features. E.g. see [marp extension for VS Code](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-vscode):
